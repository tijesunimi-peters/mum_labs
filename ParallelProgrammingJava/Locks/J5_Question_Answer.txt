J5 A Parallel Stack can be implemented using an
array to store the values, and a Top pointer to
indicate the index of the current top element.
The following three methods are needed:
Push(x): put item x on top of stack
Pop(y): remove top of stack and return in y
Clear: initialize stack to empty
Implement a Parallel Stack class in Java and test it
using many parallel threads.
